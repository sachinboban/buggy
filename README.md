# Gesture Controlled Robot

A gesture controlled robot is a simple vehicle, whose movement is
controlled by the gestures or movement of a simple controller. Depending on the
gesture made using the controller, the robot can move forward, backward, left,
right or halt. The robot can also move forward or backward while making a left
or right turn.

## Features
* Wireless control
* Forward/Backward motion with 3-level speed controlled
* Turn Left/Right
* Turn Left/Right while move Forward/Backward

# Software requirements

Download and install the Arduino software to run the .ino file.

# Hardware requirements

This project can be divided and designed into two major parts:
1. Transmitter side:

The components used on the transmitter side include a 2 axis accelerometer(ADXL335), an encoder(HT12E), a 433MHz RF     transmitter, a simple copper wire to be used as an antenna and the arduino uno board built using the ATmega32 chip.
